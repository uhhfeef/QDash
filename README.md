   - Type in natural language directly in the chatbox to create a chart

2. **Customizing Visualizations**:
   - Coming soon: Drag and drop to move, resize, and rotate charts
   - Coming soon: Edit and customize chart properties

## Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:
```env
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional - for analytics
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=your_langfuse_secret_key
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_langfuse_public_key
LANGFUSE_HOST=your_langfuse_host

# Security
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret  # Used for cookie encryption
```

3. Make sure the environment variables are loaded:
   - For local development, the variables will be automatically loaded from `.env`
   - For production, set these variables in your deployment environment

## Helper Commands

Here are some useful commands for development:

```bash
# Start local development server (with hot reload)
npm run dev:local

# Start local server (production build)
npm run local

# Build the project
npm run build

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenAI API Issues**
   - Error: "Failed to process chat request"
   - Solution: Check your OpenAI API key in `.env`
   - Make sure you have sufficient API credits

2. **Session/Login Issues**
   - Error: "Unauthorized" or "Invalid session"
   - Solution: Clear browser cookies and try logging in again
   - Default credentials: username: `demo`, password: `demo123`

3. **Port Already in Use**
   - The server will automatically find an available port
   - Default port is 3000, will increment if busy

4. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Reinstall dependencies
   npm install

   # If you have issues with specific packages
   npm install dotenv openai @hono/node-server
   ```

### Development Tips

1. **Checking Logs**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Check Console for error messages
   - Server logs will appear in your terminal

2. **Testing the API**
   - Use the built-in chat interface
   - All API endpoints require authentication except:
     - `/api/login`
     - `/api/register`

3. **File Locations**
   - Built files are in `dist/`
   - Source files are in `src/`
   - Static assets should go in `public/`
